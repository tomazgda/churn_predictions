# churn_predictions
A project for my work experience at Sky UK.

Dataset used is the Telco Customer Churn dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn.

Built with python, [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

## Goal
The goal is to be able to input some training data, and data without targets ('New' data), and output predictions for the new data as well as scores in the form of a report on model performance.
